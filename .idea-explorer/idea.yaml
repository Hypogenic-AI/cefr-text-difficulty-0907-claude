  title: Modeling Text Difficulty Using CEFR Levels
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Linguistic factors such as lexical frequency, syntactic complexity,
    and language model surprisal contribute more to perceived text difficulty, as
    measured by CEFR levels, than treating text difficulty as a black-box machine
    learning label.

    '
  background:
    description: This project studies text difficulty as a linguistic property rather
      than a black-box machine learning label. Using an existing dataset of English
      sentences annotated with CEFR levels, we first analyze which linguistic factors,
      such as lexical frequency, syntactic complexity, and language model surprisal,
      contribute most to perceived difficulty. We compare traditional NLP features
      with a pretrained BERT-based CEFR predictor and conduct diagnostic experiments
      to understand model behavior.
